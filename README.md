Counter:

A counter is essentially a variable that keeps track of a numerical value. In JavaScript, we can create a variable using the ‘var’, ‘let’, or ‘const’ keywords. We will be using the ‘let’ keyword to create our counter variable, which can be incremented or decremented based on user actions.
